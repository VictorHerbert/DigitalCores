# DigitalCores

## Overview

DigitalCores is a collection of reusable SystemVerilog modules designed for digital hardware development. It includes various components such as arithmetic units, memory interfaces, and VGA signal generators, all structured for easy integration into larger projects. A `Makefile` is provided to automate compilation using different synthesis and simulation tools.

## Repository Structure

- **Adders**: Modules for performing arithmetic addition operations.  
- **BarrelShift**: Modules implementing barrel shifters for efficient bit-wise shifting.  
- **DoubleDabble**: Binary-to-BCD conversion using the double dabble algorithm.  
- **Fifo**: First-In-First-Out memory buffer modules.  
- **Memory**: Various memory components and interfaces.  
- **VGA**: Modules for generating VGA signals.  
- **scripts**: Scripts to assist with simulation and synthesis.  
- **utils**: General-purpose utility modules.  
- **Makefile**: Automates compilation using different tools.
